# RPGCharacterGenerator

	This application generates an RPG character for an RPG in a cyberpunk setting.
	Instead of character creation, the player is assigned a class based on a personality test
	of our own design. These characters are added to a party in Dungeons and Dragons fashion.

## To-Do:
- Discuss attribute/class/race system
	- This should be well documented in the repo
- Implement player class
- Implement party class
- Implement actual RPG program

## Wishlist

- List of 50 externally stored 'personality type' questions to generate players
- Races that affect base stats
- Distinct parties and "campaigns"
